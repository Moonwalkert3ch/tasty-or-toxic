## Project Inspiration:
AS a group, we were inspired by our shared interest in plants and survival, and knowing it matched with the theme of "hobby", it did not take long to have many inspired ideas.
Ultimately, we settled on The Hikers Guide: Toxic or Tasty, which utilizes a 3rd party API to identify plants that are either edible or poisonous. The search results include:
- Common Name
- Scientific Name
- Other Names
- Cycle
- Image
Future iterations will include more sort criteria, such as searching by location, which includes possible integration of a 2nd API.

We kept the website simple and focused, with a navigation bar, carousel of related images, and contact information. We utilized Bootstrap to keep the design simple and the CSS minimal. For our API, we utilized the perenual API.
