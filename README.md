# The Hiker's Guide: Toxic or Tasty

## Project Overview
**The Hiker's Guide: Toxic or Tasty** is a web application designed to help outdoor enthusiasts identify whether a plant is edible or poisonous. Leveraging the [Perenual API](https://perenual.com/api/species-list), users can search for plants and receive detailed information including:
- **Common Name**
- **Scientific Name**
- **Other Names**
- **Growth Cycle**
- **Images**

In future iterations, we plan to enhance the functionality by adding more search criteria, such as filtering plants by geographic location, and potentially integrating additional APIs.

## Project Inspiration
This project was born from our collective passion for plants and survival. With the theme of "hobby" as our guide, we quickly converged on the idea of a tool that could be both educational and practical for hikers. The result is a streamlined, user-friendly application that could be a valuable resource for anyone exploring the great outdoors.
